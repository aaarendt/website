    "\n",
    "- A camera trap (sometimes referred to as a remote camera or hunting camera) is similar to a normal camera except they:\n",
    "    - *1) can take pictures at consistent intervals at settings preset by the user.*  \n",
    "    - *2) are designed to withstand harsh conditions and to be left up for long periods of time.* \n",
    "- Their potential for snow hydrology is exciting. Consistent daily camera trap photos can be analyzed continuously to form a *time-lapse* of snow conditions at one location. "
